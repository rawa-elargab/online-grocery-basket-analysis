# Online grocery basket analysis - case of Instacart

Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.

In this project, I'm using this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order. 

The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we have between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also have the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.
